# Sunspots-

There are three main theories that link sunspots and economic activity. The first one dates back to Jevons and the Marginalists, saying that those phenomena affect agricultural production, hence, it affects real economic output. The second one is that people coordinate on sunspots or other geomagnetic variables that are irrelevant but use it as a mean to coordinate among different potential equilibria. The final one is a behavioral one. Solar activity may affect human mood which then could affect aggregate risk preferences in asset prices.

Our objective is to test the third hypothesis using quantitative methods.
